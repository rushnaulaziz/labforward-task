### Time Consumption:

- Most of my time is consumed in understanding the task since the requirements are not clear in given task documents
- At first I thought the task is about automating the flow, but that is not a 4-6 hours of task
- arround 2-3 hours are consumed in creating the app structure and workflow
- Rest is consumed in data task
- I didnot add the formulas of the last table since its is not mentioned in the document 
- In general it took 4-5 hours for me to complete the task.
